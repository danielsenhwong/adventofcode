# Advent of Code
Daniel Wong 

## December 2020
Started trying my hand at these puzzles again. Still using Python, but now with a Python for Windows environment and using Microsoft Visual Studio Code as the IDE.
1. [Python](https://www.python.org/getit/)
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
    1. be sure to switch to the Python version installed in the bottom left corner of the Visual Studio Code window!

## December 2015
These are my solutions to the Advent of Code (http://adventofcode.com/) puzzles
for December 2015 as I practice using Python and learn how to use vim.  

```shell
~/.vimrc: 
    :syntax on 
    :set tw=80 
    :set ts=8 expandtab sw=4 sts=4
    :set wrap linebreak nolist
    :filetype indent on
```
